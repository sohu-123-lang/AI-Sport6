This repository contains the official implementation of our paper:  
**"A Conditional Gating–Based Cross-Fusion Network for Pre-Stroke Drop Point Prediction in Badminton"**  
*(Currently under review at AAAI 2026)*

## 🌟 Introduction
Our Conditional Gate-Based Cross-Fusion Network (ConFu) is a novel multimodal framework that predicts badminton shuttlecock landing positions **300ms before stroke execution** by integrating:
- 3D shuttlecock trajectory reconstruction
- Player dynamic localization 
- Keypoint-based arm gestures
- Stroke type classification

The model achieves **92.6% accuracy** (within 0.3m) and **97ms inference time**, enabling real-time tactical feedback.

## 🚀 Key Features
| Feature | Technical Innovation | Benefit |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| **Multimodal Fusion** | Combines 4 data streams with cross-attention | 12.6% more accurate than unimodal baselines |
| **Conditional Gating** | Dynamic feature recalibration via LSTM | 23% faster inference by suppressing noise |
| **Spatio-Temporal Encoding** | Dual-branch transformer architecture | Captures both trajectory dynamics and court positioning |
| **Early Prediction** | Forecasts at stroke moment (not post-trajectory) | Provides 1.25s decision time advantage |
