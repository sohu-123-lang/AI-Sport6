## 🌟 Introduction
Our Conditional Gate-Based Cross-Fusion Network (ConFu) is a novel multimodal framework that predicts badminton shuttlecock landing positions **300ms before stroke execution** by integrating:
- 3D shuttlecock trajectory reconstruction
- Player dynamic localization 
- Keypoint-based arm gestures
- Stroke type classification

The model achieves **92.6% accuracy** (within 0.3m) and **97ms inference time**, enabling real-time tactical feedback.

## 🚀 Key Features
| Feature | Technical Innovation | Benefit |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| **Multimodal Fusion** | Combines 4 data streams with cross-attention | 12.6% more accurate than unimodal baselines |
| **Conditional Gating** | Dynamic feature recalibration via LSTM | 23% faster inference by suppressing noise |
| **Spatio-Temporal Encoding** | Dual-branch transformer architecture | Captures both trajectory dynamics and court positioning |
| **Early Prediction** | Forecasts at stroke moment (not post-trajectory) | Provides 1.25s decision time advantage |

### Evaluation Metrics
```python
# MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
mae = torch.mean(torch.abs(predictions - targets))

# Accuracy@0.3m
accuracy = (torch.norm(predictions - targets, dim=1) < 0.3).float().mean()
```
